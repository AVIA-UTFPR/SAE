\title{AIL Tutorial 4 -- Dynamic and Random Environments}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
This is the fourth a series of tutorials on the use of the Agent Infrastructure Layer (\ail).  This tutorial covers creating environments for agent programs which contain dynamic or random behaviour.   Dynamic behaviour is behaviour that may occur without the agents doing anything to cause it.  Random behaviour is when the outcome of an action, the input to a sensor, or the dynamic behaviour of the environment has some element of chance to it.

Files for this tutorial can be found in the \texttt{mcapl} distribution in the directory \texttt{src/examples/gwendolen/ail\_tutorials/tutorial4}.

The tutorial assumes a good working knowledge of Java programming and an understanding of the basics of construction \ail\ environments as discussion in \ail\ tutorial 2.
