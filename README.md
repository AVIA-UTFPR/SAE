# SAE
The Simulated Automotive Environment (SAE) comprises: implementation, formal verification and simulation of controlling mechanisms for Autonomous Vehicles by means of MCAPL framework.

This project utilizes the Model Checking Agent Programming Language (MCAPL) framework in order to implement and formal verify some basic controlling mechanism for Autonomous Vehicles.

Our Simulated Automotive Environment (SAE) comprises the following:

• Gwendolen rational agent responsible for basic driving plans and obstacle avoidance.

• Formal verification properties written in Temporal logic.

• Verification of these properties via AJPF model checking.

• Simulated environment implemented in Java.

In order to run the SAE it is necessary to use MCAPL and the related tools: Gwendolen agent programming, AJPF model checking.
